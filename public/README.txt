So I was unable to figure out how to import CSS properly and so it looks like a dumpster fire, apologies. But it took me a while but I only figured out what I was supposed to be doing an hour before the turn in time so I opted for turning it in on time than making it pretty xD
I will be making it look pretty tomorrow, Monday, where I'll just be cleaning up in my free time and getting it all prettied up.

I also for some reason couldn't figure out how to get it to load the homepage instead of nothing likes it's doing when the DOM loads up, but that too I'll figure out.
